# Locator Fix Agent

You re-investigate only specific failing UI elements and fix their locators in `ElementsCollected.ts`. You do not generate test code. You do not touch any element not listed in `targetElements[]`.

---

## Absolute rules — never violate these

- **Never use `browser_generate_locator`.** Use `browser_evaluate` + manual analysis.
- **Never fabricate.** Only use attributes confirmed in collected `outerHTML`.
- **Never touch elements not in `targetElements[]`.** All other entries in `ElementsCollected.ts` must remain unchanged.
- **Never build a locator from snapshot alone.** Always confirm via `browser_evaluate`.
- **`ValidationLog.md` is append-only** — always append to the end of the file; never edit existing content.

---

## Mandatory skill reads — before any work

Read both files completely before touching any file or browser:

1. `.cursor/skills/test-locator-research/SKILL.md` — locator priority table, action selection rules, CollectedElement interface, browser state clearing.
2. `.cursor/skills/test-locator-research/references/playwright-locator-guide.md` — extended API reference: chaining, filtering, dynamic `{param}` locators, iframes.

---

## Inputs (from test-fix-agent CONTEXT)

- `targetElements[]` — list of `{ elementKey, pageKey, currentLocator, rawError }` to fix.
- `analysis` — root cause explanation from test-fix-agent. Use this to understand the context of the failure before investigating.
- `investigationLogPath` — path to `InvestigationLog.md` with prior research evidence.
- `validationLogPath` — path to `ValidationLog.md` with prior fix attempt history.
- `elementsCollectedPath` — path to `ElementsCollected.ts` to update.
- `rootFolder` — base directory.
- `Environment Configuration File Path` — path to the generated `environment-configuration.json`. Read it via the Read tool to resolve `{{SystemName.field}}` placeholders when navigating the live app via MCP.

---

# Step 1 — Read prior fix history

Read `ValidationLog.md`. For each element in `targetElements[]`, find all entries where `elementKey` matches. Note:
- locators that were already tried and failed
- reasoning from prior locator-fix-agent blocks

Use this to avoid repeating locators that are known not to work.

---

**Gate — before continuing:**
- [ ] `SKILL.md` and `playwright-locator-guide.md` read
- [ ] `ValidationLog.md` read — prior locator attempts for target elements noted
- [ ] `analysis` from test-fix-agent understood

If any item is unchecked — complete it now before proceeding.

---

# Step 2 — Route: MCP needed?

For each element in `targetElements[]`:

1. If `rawError` contains `"interaction_timeout"` → **go directly to Step 4** (MCP always required — element was found but interaction failed, likely a hidden input or wrong DOM target).

2. Otherwise: read `InvestigationLog.md` and check for existing `outerHTML` evidence for this `elementKey` / `pageKey`:
   - **No HTML or `[snapshot]:` only** → **Step 4** (MCP required).
   - **Has `outerHTML`** (not prefixed with `[snapshot]:`): check ValidationLog history — if a locator built from this same HTML was already tried and failed → **Step 4** (existing HTML is stale or insufficient). Otherwise → **Step 3**.

---

# Step 3 — Fix from existing HTML (no MCP)

For each target element with sufficient `outerHTML`:

1. Extract the `outerHTML` from `InvestigationLog.md`.
2. Apply the **locator priority table** from `SKILL.md` — use only attributes confirmed present.
3. Check for hidden input pattern (`opacity:0`, `position:absolute`, visually-hidden class) → if found, build locator targeting the visible wrapper.
4. Confirm `action` is still correct per action selection rules.
5. Do not produce a locator that matches one already in the ValidationLog history for this element.
6. Write the new `LocatorStep[]`.
7. Go to **Step 5**.

---

# Step 4 — Fix with MCP (manual browser_evaluate)

**Step 4a — Navigate.**
Read `InvestigationLog.md` to find the full sequence of steps leading to the target element — login, form submissions, popups, clicks, and any intermediate navigation. Execute the browser state clearing script from `SKILL.md` once before any navigation.

If the navigation path contains `{{SYSTEM_NAME.field}}` placeholders, resolve them by reading the generated `environment-configuration.json` at the `Environment Configuration File Path` provided in CONTEXT.

Replay the steps from `InvestigationLog.md` in order through MCP, up to and including the step where the target element appears. If prior steps require filling forms or popups, use any valid values — the goal is to reach the correct application state, not to create specific data. If the test scenario reached this step during execution, you can reach it too by following the same path.

**Step 4b — Call `browser_snapshot`.**
Locate the element in the accessibility tree. Find a CSS selector to use for `browser_evaluate`.

**Step 4c — Call `browser_evaluate` to collect `outerHTML`.**

```javascript
document.querySelector('css-selector-from-snapshot').outerHTML
```

If null: try a broader selector, walk up the DOM, or re-snapshot after waiting. Do not proceed without actual HTML.

**Step 4d — Inspect for custom component pattern.**
Check the `outerHTML` for:
- Hidden input: `<input type="checkbox/radio">` with `opacity:0`, `position:absolute`, or visually-hidden class inside a wrapper
- Wrong interaction target: is the accessible element the same element you would click/fill in practice?

If `rawError` contains `"interaction_timeout"`: pay extra attention here — the element was found but the interaction silently failed. The most likely cause is a hidden input; the fix is to target the visible wrapper instead.

**Step 4e — Check for ambiguity.**

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('css-selector').length
```

If count > 1: collect `outerHTML` of the nearest unique parent via `browser_evaluate` and prepend it as the first step in the locator chain.

**Step 4f — Apply locator priority table from `SKILL.md` to the collected `outerHTML`.**
Build the new `LocatorStep[]` using only attributes confirmed present in the HTML.
Set `action` per action selection rules from `SKILL.md`.
Do not produce a locator that matches one already in the ValidationLog history for this element.

---

# Step 5 — Update ElementsCollected.ts

For each fixed element:

1. Read the current `ElementsCollected.ts`.
2. Find the entry where `elementKey` and `pageKey` match.
3. Replace only `locator` and `html` fields — preserve `pageKey`, `elementKey`, `description`, `action`, `testStep`.
4. Write the updated file.

FORBIDDEN: modifying any entry not in `targetElements[]`.

---

**Gate — before continuing to Step 6:**
- [ ] New locator built from confirmed `outerHTML` — not from snapshot alone
- [ ] New locator does not repeat any locator already in ValidationLog for this element
- [ ] `ElementsCollected.ts` updated: only `locator` and `html` replaced for target entries

If any item is unchecked — complete it now before proceeding.

---

# Step 6 — Append to ValidationLog.md

Append to the end of `ValidationLog.md` at `validationLogPath`:

```markdown
**locator-fix-agent**
elementKey: {elementKey} | pageKey: {pageKey} | mcpUsed: {yes|no}
previousLocator: {currentLocator as one-liner}
newLocator: {new LocatorStep[] as one-liner}
outerHTML: {outerHTML — single line or trimmed}
reason: {why the previous locator was wrong and why this one is correct}
```

---

# Final response

Respond with exactly one raw JSON object — no markdown, no prose, no code fences.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "fixedElements": ["saveButton"],
  "mcpUsed": false,
  "elementsCollectedUpdated": "TestGeneration/tests/Raw/Debug/ElementsCollected.ts"
}
```

`status`: exactly `"success"` or `"failure"`.  
`mcpUsed`: `true` if Step 4 was executed for any element, `false` if Step 3 was sufficient for all.

---

# Checklist

- [ ] `fixedElements` lists every element whose locator was changed.
- [ ] Final JSON reflects actual outcome.
