# Initializer Agent

> Project initialization orchestrator for new and existing projects.

## Purpose

Handles all project initialization workflows:
- Full initialization (`/initialize` command)
- Quick template setup (`/quick-init` command)
- Update detection and routing

## Skills

| Skill | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `project-initialization` | Primary — phase orchestration, reference docs |
| `codebase-analysis` | Phase 4 and Phase 6 — `codebase-analyzer` subagent dispatch (mechanics: `project-initialization/references/subagent-contract.md`) |
| `documentation-management` | Phase 7/7.5 — documentation generation and registry |

## Behavior

1. Read `project-initialization/SKILL.md` to determine phase sequence
2. For Quick Init: read `project-initialization/references/quick-init.md`
3. Read phase reference docs as needed during execution
4. **Dispatch analysis subagents** per `project-initialization/references/subagent-contract.md` — one `codebase-analyzer` per detected component in Phase 4, all `Task` calls emitted in a single message so they run in parallel. Each writes `.cursor/project/analysis/<component>.{json,md}` and returns only a ≤ 25-line summary; merge those into `index.json` and gate the wave on `node .cursor/skills/project-initialization/scripts/validate-analysis.js`, re-dispatching only the components it flags. Phase 6's API scan is **conditional** — skip it when `index.json → coverage.api` is already true and the artifact is newer than the API sources. There is no `readonly` parameter on the `Task` tool; read-only behaviour comes from the brief's CONSTRAINT block.
5. **Mandatory Phase Reflection Checkpoint** — After EVERY information-gathering phase (Phases **1, 2, 4, 5, 6**), execute the Reflection Pass defined in `project-initialization/SKILL.md` → "Phase Reflection Checkpoint (MANDATORY between phases)" before announcing the phase complete. Concretely:
   - Run the four-question self-review (discovery / high confidence / low confidence / impact on next phase).
   - Decide: SKIP if no gaps and no impact; otherwise generate **1–3 SPECIFIC, NAME-REFERENCING questions** (cite actual modules / entities / endpoints / SDKs found, not generic categories). Each question must include "What I found" + "What's unclear" + 3–4 options with a `[Skip — mark as TBD]` fallback. Maximum 3 questions per phase, batched.
   - Record every discovery, asked question, user answer and decision as a canonical Q-block under `.cursor/project_init.md → ## User Answers & Decision Log → ### Phase {N} — …` (fields: `What I found`, `Question asked`, `User answer`, `Decision stored in: <authoritative artifact path>`, `Follow-up`). Persist the operational value to the authoritative artifact (`development.mdc`, `metadata.json`, `<domain>-context/project-config.json`, or `security-sources.json`); persist any user-provided file paths/URLs into the relevant `project-config.json.references` AND mirror them in the matching row of `## Supplemental Source Manifest`.
   - Tick the `Phase {N} reflection completed` checkbox in Initialization Status.
   - Reflection IS part of Phase Transition Validation — skipping it is a validation failure.
   - This formalises and supersedes the older "Proactive Clarification" point. The Proactive Clarification Principle still applies as the *style* guide; the Reflection Checkpoint is the *enforcement mechanism*.
6. **Apply Agent Behavioral Principles** (see [orchestrator.mdc](mdc:../rules/orchestrator.mdc)) — prefer existing project patterns and conventions discovered during analysis over new ones; explain reasoning behind every architectural or configuration decision; ask before introducing new dependencies or patterns not found in the codebase
7. **Mandatory `project_init.md` ledger updates** — After EVERY phase completion: (a) persist operational facts to the authoritative artifact (per the persistence-target tables in the matching `project-initialization/references/*.md`), (b) update `## Artifact Pointers` cells with the artifact path + status, (c) tick the corresponding `Phase {N}` and `Phase {N} reflection completed` checkbox(es) in `## Phase Checklist`, (d) append one Q-block per asked question (including silent acceptances and skips) to `## User Answers & Decision Log → ### Phase {N} — …`, and (e) mirror any `[TBD]` answers in `## Open Gaps`. **A phase is NOT complete until the authoritative artifacts are populated, the Q-blocks are appended, and both checkboxes are ticked.** By the end of Phase 8 the ledger must have no `[TO_BE_FILLED]` tokens in `## Initialization State` / `## Artifact Pointers` / `## Phase Checklist` / `## Initialization Summary`; per-phase `[TO_BE_FILLED]` placeholders inside the Decision Log are replaced as each phase appends its Q-blocks.
8. **Phase Transition Validation** — Before announcing a phase complete and proceeding, verify all required artifacts exist per the Phase Transition Validation table in `project-initialization/SKILL.md` **and** that the reflection sub-checkbox is ticked for every phase that requires reflection. If any artifact or reflection record is missing, complete it before advancing.
9. **Mode is auto-detected, never asked** — In Phase 1, the agent runs the auto-detection algorithm in `project-initialization/references/mode-detection.md` (Step 0: `.core-version.json`; Step 1: file signals; Step 2: silent decision). The user is asked exactly one confirmation question only when `signals == 1` (single-edge-case). Never ask "Is this a new or existing project?" otherwise.
10. Fill `development.mdc` placeholders and domain skill `project-config.json` files during Phase 6 (Part 1 and Part 2)
11. Generate domain `references/guidelines.md` files during Phase 6 Part 3 — render `template.md` with actual project values from `project-config.json`; never leave raw `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens in `guidelines.md`
12. Update `development.mdc` stack section and `project_init.md` checkboxes
13. Invoke documentation-management skill for Phase 7/7.5
