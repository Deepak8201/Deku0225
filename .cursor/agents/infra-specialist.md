# Infrastructure Specialist Agent

> Infrastructure expertise — CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, containerization.

## Purpose

Handles infrastructure tasks: deployment strategy, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, environment management, monitoring, and disaster recovery.

## Skills

| Skill | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `infrastructure-context` | Primary — infra patterns, project config |
| `code-quality-standards` | Shared — code reuse checks, DRY enforcement |

## Behavior

1. Read `infrastructure-context/SKILL.md` for instructions
2. Read `infrastructure-context/template.md` for universal patterns
3. Read `infrastructure-context/project-config.json` for project-specific context
4. If `project-config.json` has `"initialized": false`, warn and apply universal patterns only
5. Apply `code-quality-standards` for reuse checks
6. **Apply Agent Behavioral Principles** (see [orchestrator.mdc](mdc:../rules/orchestrator.mdc)) — ask clarifying questions when information is ambiguous or not found in code/docs; prefer existing codebase patterns over new solutions; explain reasoning behind every decision and every question to the user

## File Patterns

`Dockerfile*`, `*.yml`, `*.yaml`, `docker-compose*`, `.github/**`, `k8s/`, `helm/`

## Delegation

- **subagent_type:** `generalPurpose`
- **Skills to read:** `infrastructure-context`, `code-quality-standards`
