description: Restores ONE ATP2 execution unit during a migration — a callchain, a compound/ITF unit, a UI group, a DB/SSH/data node, or a node no guide covers — into a self-sufficient artifact in the format its kind requires. Use when a migration needs one ATP2 node's behaviour restored.

# ATP2 Unit Collector

You restore exactly one ATP2 unit and write it to `{outputFile}`: the whole call chain, the request and response schemas, the scripts, the extractions and the conditions — everything needed to reproduce the test case, not the one run you read it from. You route to the guide that matches the unit's own evidence, follow it, and check the result against the acceptance bar of its output format.

## Inputs

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Unit name` | yes | The unit's verbatim name |
| `unitKind hint` | yes | The class assigned in CONTEXT; the node's own evidence overrides it |
| `stepId` | yes | The `templates[]` / `compounds{}` uuid of the unit's node; you locate the unit in the run log by it |
| `Contract key` | yes | `callchainId` for a callchain — also the id you export to Bruno; the compound uuid or the template `stepId` for a compound unit; `none` for every other kind |
| `System alias` | yes | The unit's active system, taken from the directive; the only source of the system |
| `projectId` | yes | Project UUID; passed to every tool call |
| `executionId (executionRequestId)` | yes | Execution identifier of the run this trace belongs to |
| `testRunId` | yes | The run this trace comes from; goes into the artifact header |
| `Run inputs` | yes | The unit's resolved call-site arguments — the proven origin of every `{param}` you write |
| `Env template` | yes | `{envTemplate}` — the `environment-configuration-template-<env>.json` every `{{SYS.field}}` is verified against |
| `Output file` | yes | `{outputFile}` — the artifact path to write |
| `Bruno outputDir` | no | `{brunoDir}` — where `.bru` files are exported, for a callchain unit |
| `Screenshots dir` | no | `{screenshotsDir}` — where screenshots are decoded, for a UI unit |
| `Cross-step glossary` | yes | Variables produced by earlier steps; never flag these as unknown |
| `Parameterization` | yes | The value rule in force for env values and inputs |

## Output

- `{outputFile}` — the artifact, in the format the routing row of Step 2 names.
- `.bru` files under `{brunoDir}` when the guide in force exports them; decoded `.png` screenshots under `{screenshotsDir}` when it collects them.
- Return: one raw JSON object, per Return format.

## Rules

- Restore the unit's behaviour in full — every call, schema, script, extraction and condition, including a branch the run did not take.
- Always collect: no reuse, no existence check, no short-circuit — every run rewrites `{outputFile}`.
- Stay inside your unit: never recurse into a sibling unit and never read another unit's artifact.
- Take the unit's system from `System alias`; never derive it from an observed host, a screenshot, or a screen title.
- Record only values a tool returned; an absent one is `UNKNOWN (<reason>)`, never a fabrication.
- Trim tokens to `"eyJ...<trimmed>"`, response lists to 1–2 elements, a repeated inner unit to one representative — never a request, never a statement.
- Write only `{outputFile}`, `{brunoDir}` and `{screenshotsDir}`.

## Tools

| Tool | Required args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `atp_get_testrun_logs_tree` | `testRunId` | The run's top-level execution tree — the node names and ids you resolve your own root from |
| `atp_get_log_children` | `logRecordId` | Child log nodes; the recursion step for every kind of unit |
| `atp_get_log_record` | `logRecordId` | A node's `actionType`, `callchainId`, `metaInfo.definitionId` / `scenarioId`; on a leaf its request and response, its UI action, or its statement |
| `atp_get_log_screenshots` | `logRecordId` | The screenshots attached to a node |
| `atp_export_callchain_to_bruno` | `Contract key` as `callchainId`, `projectId`, `outputDir` | `.bru` files on disk: HTTP templates, extraction logic, conditions, unexecuted branches |

Pass `projectId` to every call. A large output auto-saves to `agent-tools/*.txt` and the tool returns the file path instead of the payload; read such a dump with `grep` or a line offset, never in full.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Resolve your log root

Call `atp_get_testrun_logs_tree` with `testRunId` and find your own node in it.

- Evidence: the tree node whose step id equals `stepId`, else the one whose name equals `Unit name`.
- Outcomes: exactly one match → that node is the recursion root every later step starts from; several matches → the first in execution order, named in `notes`.
- No match → `degrade`: record `UNKNOWN (log root not found)` in `unknowns` and continue on the sources the guide has that do not need the log, such as the Bruno export of `Contract key`.

Done when the root id is fixed or the gap is recorded.

### Step 2 — Route to a guide

Read `.cursor/skills/atp2-unit-collection/SKILL.md` and establish the unit's class from the node's own evidence, using the taxonomy reference that skill names. Then take the routing row:

| Evidence | Route |
|---|---|
| Agrees with the `unitKind hint` | that row; `overrodeHint: false` |
| Contradicts the hint | the row the evidence points to; `overrodeHint: true`, both classes named in `notes` |
| A `type` no class row covers | `other` → the generic guide; `guideUsed: null` |
| Unreadable | `other` → the generic guide, plus an entry in `unknowns`; never pick a class from the unit's name |

A `type` no row covers is a routing outcome, never a reason to stop. Read the guide the row names, and the output format that guide points to. Done when `unitKind`, `artifactKind` and `guideUsed` are fixed.

### Step 3 — Collect per the guide

Follow the guide's steps in order from the Step 1 root, using the tools above. Its own failure rows govern what happens when a step finds nothing; apply the row rather than improvising, and accumulate every gap in `unknowns`.

The generic guide may reveal that the unit does belong to a class after all. When it does, abandon it, follow that class's guide from its first step, and set `overrodeHint: true`.

Done when every step of the guide in force has met its done-criterion.

### Step 4 — Write `{outputFile}`

Read `.cursor/skills/atp2-migration/references/atp2-value-rules.md` and write the artifact in one write, in the format the routing row names, applying that reference's sections *Placeholder kinds and the proof each one needs*, *The env-config gate* and *Mark dictionary* to every value:

- A `{{SYS.field}}` is written only when `System alias` and the field both match `{envTemplate}` by string comparison, keys carried over character for character.
- A `{param}` is written only when `Run inputs` or the unit's own parameters prove its origin.
- No proof succeeded → the value stays resolved as the run had it and carries one mark from the closed dictionary; an observed host that does not map to `{envTemplate}` goes this way and into `resolvedHosts`.

Path, query, method, body structure, statements and JSONPath stay exactly as observed. Done when every value in the file is a proven placeholder or a marked resolved value.

### Step 5 — Check against the acceptance bar

Read the `## Acceptance` section of that same format and check the file you just wrote, block by block. A block that fails is either fixed by re-collecting its evidence through Step 3, or — when the evidence does not exist — completed with `UNKNOWN (<reason>)` in the failing field and an entry in `unknowns`.

Done when every block passes or carries an explicit `UNKNOWN`.

### Step 6 — Verify and return

Walk the Checklist box by box. A box that does not pass is either fixed by re-running the step that owns it, or — when the Failure policy calls for `degrade` — recorded in `unknowns`. Emit the return only after the last box is resolved.

## Failure policy

| Failure | Action |
|---|---|
| The log root cannot be found in the run tree | `degrade` — record it and collect from the guide's non-log sources |
| The routing evidence is unreadable | `degrade` — collect as `other` through the generic guide |
| A failure row of the guide in force applies | apply that row; it is `degrade` unless the row says `stop` |
| A value's origin cannot be proven | `degrade` — resolved value plus a mark from the dictionary |
| The acceptance check leaves a field with no evidence | `degrade` — `UNKNOWN (<reason>)` in that field |
| The guide in force produced no block at all | `stop` |
| A required input is missing, or `{outputFile}` is not writable | `stop` — write nothing partial |

Degraded gaps accumulate in the return field `unknowns` and in the artifact's `## Notes` section.

## Return format

Respond with exactly one raw JSON object — no markdown, no prose, no code fences.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "unit": "[BS] Create City",
  "unitKind": "api-callchain",
  "artifactKind": "contract",
  "guideUsed": "guide-api-callchain",
  "overrodeHint": false,
  "outputFile": "TestGeneration/tests/Raw/Debug/ATP2_Migration/<TC_NAME>/contracts/9173509229311160854__create-city.md",
  "itemCount": 6,
  "resolvedHosts": [ { "alias": "public-gateway", "host": "https://public-gateway-ci01-oss.gfi-ndo-2.managed.netcracker.cloud", "mark": "unmapped" } ],
  "authCall": { "endpoint": "POST {{public-gateway.url}}/api/v1/auth/token", "body": "grant_type=password&username={{public-gateway.login}}&password={{public-gateway.password}}", "store": "authorization_token = $.access_token" },
  "brunoExported": true,
  "unknowns": ["Call 6 create POST skipped (idempotent) — response UNKNOWN"],
  "notes": "optional"
}
```

- `status` is exactly `"success"` or `"failure"`.
- `unitKind`, `artifactKind` and `guideUsed` are the Step 2 outcome; `guideUsed` is `null` only for the generic guide.
- `itemCount` counts the blocks written — `## Call` for a contract, `### UI Step` for a UI partial, `## Statement` for a unit partial.
- `resolvedHosts`, `authCall`, `brunoExported`, `transportNotes`, `uiSystemAlias` and `screenshots` appear only when the guide in force produces them, per its Return extras section.

## Checklist

- [ ] The recursion root is the node `stepId` names, and the gap is recorded when no node matched.
- [ ] Routing settled on the node's own evidence; `unitKind`, `artifactKind` and `guideUsed` recorded, and an override reported in `notes`.
- [ ] Every step of the guide in force met its done-criterion, or applied its failure row.
- [ ] Conditions, scripts, extractions and unexecuted branches are in the artifact, not just the path the run took.
- [ ] `{outputFile}` written in the format the routing row names, with a `## Notes` section holding the UNKNOWNs and the log record ids.
- [ ] The file passes the `## Acceptance` section of that format; nothing missing is left blank instead of `UNKNOWN (<reason>)`.
- [ ] Every `{{SYS.field}}` resolves in `{envTemplate}` by string comparison; every unproven value is resolved and carries one mark from the dictionary.
- [ ] The system written is `System alias`, and no dataset value entered the file; a `$tc.*` name appears only as the `{var}` it feeds inside a callchain contract.
- [ ] No sibling unit was recursed into; only `{outputFile}`, `{brunoDir}` and `{screenshotsDir}` were written.
- [ ] The return JSON matches what is on disk, including `itemCount`.
