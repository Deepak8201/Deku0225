# APM Workflow — Single Source of Truth

> **Verified against APM 0.28.0** (2026-09-03, `opencode`-target smoke tests on this line; `.opencode/rules/.core-version.json → apmVersionExpected`). Facts below were re-checked against the upstream 0.28.0 [release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/releases/tag/v0.28.0), the current docs at <https://microsoft.github.io/apm/>, and hands-on runs. What this line relies on: (1) the **dict-form dependency** (`git:`/`path:`/`ref:`); (2) **`targets: [opencode]`** in every generated `apm.yml` (Section 4); (3) **`AGENTS.md` co-ownership is `compilation.agents_md.mode: managed_section`** — `apm compile` manages only the `<!-- apm:start -->` / `<!-- apm:end -->` region (Section 5); (4) the opencode target **deploys no hooks** and puts package skills under `.agents/skills/` (Sections 4–6); (5) a plain `apm install` **overwrites** the initialized files of package skills — hence the install wrapper (Section 5).

## 1. Overview

The AI Workplace is built on top of the **Agent Package Manager (APM)** — Microsoft's dependency manager for AI agent configuration. APM installs packaged primitives (instructions, prompts, agents, skills, hooks, MCP servers) into the harness directories every supported AI assistant understands. Valid `--target` values for `apm compile`/`apm install` on 0.28.0 are: `copilot`, `claude`, `cursor`, `opencode`, `codex`, `gemini`, `antigravity` (alias `agy`), `windsurf`, `kiro`, `intellij`, `vscode`, `grok-build`, `agent-skills`, `agents`, `all`, plus the experimental `copilot-app`, `copilot-cowork`, `grok-cloud`, `hermes` and `openclaw` (each behind `apm experimental enable`). `apm install --help` prints the current list; `apm targets` prints only the auto-detectable harnesses (9 on 0.28.0).

- `all` **excludes** `agent-skills`, `antigravity`, and `intellij` — combine them explicitly (`--target all,intellij`) to include them.
- `intellij` (GitHub Copilot for JetBrains IDEs) is a first-class target: its file primitives deploy through the Copilot profile (`.github/…` plus `.agents/skills/`) while the IntelliJ-specific adapter writes JetBrains Copilot's user-scope MCP config. `--runtime intellij` still works but is only a **legacy single-value alias** for `--target`.
- `grok-build` (new in 0.28.0) is a first-class target: it auto-detects on a `.grok/` directory and is included in the `all` expansion. Skills deploy to Grok's native `.grok/skills/` path (like Claude's `.claude/skills/` and Kiro's `.kiro/skills/`, it is unaffected by the legacy-paths variable).
- `copilot-cowork`, `copilot-app`, `openclaw`, `hermes`, and `grok-cloud` are **experimental** targets: they need `apm experimental enable <name>` and are not valid in a manifest's top-level `target:` / `targets:` enum (see Section 4). They are outside the Workplace support baseline.

See the upstream [Targets matrix](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/targets-matrix/) for the current, authoritative per-harness matrix.

Why APM here:

- One source of truth for every Workplace package (role-pack, full module, or single skill) lives in the standalone **Workplace-Agent-Packages** repo (<https://git.netcracker.com/DEMO.SE.AI/Workplace-Agent-Packages.git>), one `<id>/` directory per package at the repo root. The URL is recorded in `.opencode/rules/.core-version.json → apmPackages.registryRepoUrl`.
- Cross-harness installability is handled by APM — Workplace does not maintain per-harness shims.
- Reproducible installs via `apm.lock.yaml`.
- Activation logic for full modules lives in idempotent `scripts/activate.{sh,ps1}`. Packages also ship a `.apm/hooks/activate.json` descriptor for harnesses with a session-start hook (Claude Code and similar); the opencode target deploys no hooks at all, so **direct invocation of the script is the only path** — see Section 6 (it is **not** `apm run activate -p <pkg>`; that command does not exist upstream).

## 2. APM CLI installation (Phase 0 gate)

Every initializer / updater flow that touches APM (`/initialize`, `/quick-init`, `/package-new`, `/update-workplace`) **MUST** run the following gate before any APM call:

```text
apm --version   # exit 0 + semver -> continue
                # not found       -> install, then re-check
                # still fails     -> abort with link to upstream installer
                #                   (exception: /quick-init degrades gracefully —
                #                    apmAvailable=false, package offer skipped)
```

| OS | Primary install command | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh` | `brew install microsoft/apm/apm`, `pip install apm-cli` |
| Windows (PowerShell) | `irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex` | `pip install apm-cli` |

The agent **offers to install automatically** by running the platform-appropriate primary command via the Shell tool, **only after the user explicitly consents**. If the user declines, or the auto-install fails, the agent falls back to printing the same commands verbatim and waits for the user to install manually.

> **URL rule (strict).** The agent MUST use the commands above **verbatim**. URLs like `apm.run/install.ps1`, `install.apm.dev`, or any other domain are NOT valid — only `aka.ms/apm-windows`, `aka.ms/apm-unix`, the registered `brew install microsoft/apm/apm` tap, and `pip install apm-cli` are authoritative. The single source for these is <https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/installation/>.

To install the **exact Workplace baseline** rather than whatever is newest upstream, pin it: `python -m pip install "apm-cli==0.28.0"` (any OS, needs Python 3.10+), or `$env:VERSION = "v0.28.0"; irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex` / `curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh -s -- @v0.28.0`. The bare one-liners always track the latest release and are therefore not a pin.

After install, re-run `apm --version` (on a fresh shell or with the absolute path `$env:USERPROFILE\.apm\bin\apm.exe` / `~/.apm/bin/apm`). On Windows the installer now adds both `current` and `bin` to `PATH` with the stable `current\apm.exe` **first**, so a bare `apm` call resolves the real executable in PowerShell, Git Bash, and `subprocess.run(["apm", ...])`; `bin\apm.cmd` remains only for compatibility. On success, write the detected version to `.opencode/rules/.core-version.json` under `apmVersion`. On Windows PowerShell 5.1, do not round-trip this manifest through `Get-Content | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content`; write it as UTF-8 without BOM using the Write tool, Node `fs.writeFileSync(..., 'utf-8')`, or `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText(..., New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false)`. On major-version drift (e.g. CLI 2.x vs Workplace expects 0.x) warn the user and offer to abort. Once installed, `apm self-update` (`--check` to only check) upgrades the CLI in place — prefer it over re-running the install one-liner on an existing install. **Caveat:** `apm self-update` is a no-op on CLIs installed via a package manager (e.g. `brew`) — those distributions disable it at build time and print their own upgrade message instead (`brew upgrade microsoft/apm/apm`). It is unclear whether the `pip install apm-cli` distribution is affected the same way; if `apm self-update` reports it is disabled, fall back to the same command originally used to install (`pip install --upgrade apm-cli`, `brew upgrade microsoft/apm/apm`, or re-running the platform one-liner). Because Workplace declares a specific baseline, do not run an unpinned `self-update` on a working project until the newer release has been validated and `apmVersionExpected` bumped.

**When the gate fails for a non-obvious reason, run `apm doctor`** before guessing. It prints a pass/fail table for git availability, network reachability (a `git ls-remote` probe that can take up to five seconds), credential resolution, marketplace config parsing, and executable-trust overrides. Only the git and network checks affect its exit code; the rest are informational. `apm doctor --verbose` adds the underlying diagnostics.

Full operational checklist (consent dialog, fallback, drift handling): [`apm-bootstrap.md`](apm-bootstrap.md).

## 3. Package layout for AI Workplace

Every Workplace package lives at the root of the Workplace-Agent-Packages repo as `<id>/` and has this shape:

```
<id>/
  apm.yml
  README.md
  .apm/
    agents/<name>.agent.md           # cross-harness agent primitive
    skills/<name>/SKILL.md            # + optional references/, assets/, scripts/
    instructions/<name>.instructions.md  # compiled into AGENTS.md by apm compile
    prompts/<name>.prompt.md          # surfaced as slash commands per target
    hooks/activate.json               # session-start hook descriptor — hook-merge targets only (Claude Code and similar); not deployed on opencode
  scripts/
    activate.sh                       # POSIX activation logic
    activate.ps1                      # Windows sibling, same contract
  runtime/                            # optional, modules only
```

### `apm.yml` — the manifest

The mandatory fields are the standard APM ones (`name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `dependencies.apm`, `dependencies.mcp`, `scripts`). Workplace adds **one** extra top-level block:

```yaml
x-workplace:
  schemaVersion: 1
  type: role-pack | module | skill
  targetRoles: []        # roles that auto-activate this package in Phase 1.7-APM
  optional: false        # true => offered in Pass A.5 (batched yes/no)
  standaloneOnly: false  # true => never offered during /initialize; offered by /quick-init Step 4.5 (empty targetRoles) or manual
  contextSkills: []      # *-context skills whose guidelines.md is mandatory
  activate:              # modules only
    script: scripts/activate.sh
    markerFile: .workplace/activated/<name>.marker
    movesRuntimeFolder: true
```

APM ignores unknown top-level keys, so the block survives `apm install` unchanged (the [manifest schema](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/manifest-schema/) §2 states "Unknown top-level keys MUST be preserved by writers but MAY be ignored by resolvers" — unchanged through 0.28.0; there is still no native APM equivalent of `x-workplace`, so this stays a Workplace-only convention). Its schema is `_schema/x-workplace.schema.json` in the Workplace-Agent-Packages repo; that repo's CI rejects any `apm.yml` whose block fails validation.

> **Hook descriptors — what happens on this target.** `.apm/hooks/*.json` files are keyed by lifecycle event name and are merged into a harness's native hook file only on targets that have one (upstream's [hooks authoring reference](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/producer/author-primitives/hooks-and-commands/) lists the accepted names and merge targets per harness). The `opencode` target profile excludes hooks entirely — verified on 0.28.0: after `apm install` no hook file exists anywhere under `.opencode/`, and the package's `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/activate` reference is never materialised. Consequence for this line: module activation is exclusively the direct script invocation of Section 6; nothing runs on session start.
>
> **Native replacement to adopt for the `module` type (evaluated, not yet applied).** APM ships a harness-independent primitive for exactly this one-shot-activation use case: [`apm lifecycle`](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/lifecycle/) scripts (a `lifecycle:` block in `apm.yml`; events `pre-install`, `post-install`, `pre-update`, `post-update`, `pre-uninstall`, `post-uninstall`). A `post-install` script fires **during `apm install` itself**, inside the APM CLI process, so it depends on no harness hook support and no event-name mapping. It is now a full command group — `apm lifecycle init` scaffolds the block, `validate` checks the schema, `test [EVENT] [--execute]` fires a synthetic event, and `trust` / `untrust` manage consent. The one operational catch: **project-source lifecycle scripts are skipped until the consumer runs `apm lifecycle trust`** (trust is bound to a SHA-256 of the `lifecycle:` subtree, so editing it revokes trust), and `APM_NO_SCRIPTS=1` or an org `executables.deny_all: true` suppresses them entirely. Switching the `module` package type over is an architecture change requiring a decision on that trust step — **still out of scope for a doc-accuracy pass**, but it is now the recommended direction rather than merely "worth evaluating."
>
> **Executable-trust gate (opt-in).** `apm install` can gate dependency-provided hooks / `bin/` executables / self-defined MCP servers / canvas extensions behind an `executables:` allow-list in the consumer's `apm.yml` OR an org policy, managed with `apm approve` / `apm deny` ([reference](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/approve/)). The gate activates only when one of those layers declares a non-empty `executables:` block; otherwise executables deploy unconditionally. Workplace-generated `apm.yml` files declare none, so packages shipping `scripts/activate.*` install without extra approval today. If a future Workplace release or an org policy turns the gate on, activation will need an explicit `apm approve <package>`. Use `apm policy explain` to see which layer produced a given decision.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Hard version of the `x-workplace` schema. Always `1` today; bumped only on breaking changes. |
| `type` | Package shape: `role-pack` (lightweight bundle), `module` (full module with `scripts/activate.*`), or `skill` (single shareable skill). |
| `targetRoles` | Roles that intersect-match selected roles during `/initialize` Phase 1.7-APM. Empty array + `optional: true` => never auto-selected. |
| `optional` | Offered in Pass A.5 with a batched yes/no prompt rather than auto-activating. |
| `standaloneOnly` | Skipped entirely during `/initialize`; user must add the dependency manually via `apm install` or editing `apm.yml`. |
| `contextSkills` | Names of `*-context` skills whose `references/guidelines.md` MUST be rendered before the package counts as active (Phase 6 Part 3.5 gate, preserved verbatim). |
| `activate.*` | Module activation contract — see Section 6. |

---

## 4. Registry sources (Phase 1.7-APM)

The package catalogue lives in a separate repo, so it is **not** locally available in the consumer project at init time. The initializer fetches the registry index over HTTPS instead. Three modes:

| Mode | Source of `index.json` | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in Workplace** (default) | Raw file from the Workplace-Agent-Packages repo URL stored in `.opencode/rules/.core-version.json → apmPackages.registryRepoUrl`. URL pattern: `{repo}/raw/{branch}/index.json`. | Standard initialization. |
| **External URL** | One or more user-supplied URLs to JSON documents matching the `_schema/index.schema.json` contract. May be GitHub/GitLab raw URLs, `https://`, or anything reachable from the agent's host. | Org-internal mirrors, private package catalogs, forks. |
| **Both (merged)** | Built-in + one or more external URLs. Entries merged by `name`. On conflict the built-in wins by default; user can override per package. | Internal packs layered on top of the canonical catalogue. |

### Built-in source resolution ladder

The initializer's `prepare-apm-packages.ps1` script tries these sources **in order** and stops on first success:

1. **HTTPS raw URL** — `<apmPackages.registryRepoUrl-without-.git>/raw/<branch>/index.json`. Works on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
2. **Authenticated git clone** — `git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse` of `apmPackages.registryRepoUrl` (a `--sparse` clone checks out the repo's root-level files, including `index.json`). Used automatically when the HTTPS response was an HTML auth-wall page **or** the user / agent passes `-AllowGitFallback`. This uses the host's existing credentials (Git Credential Manager, SSH key, PAT). The clone goes to `.opencode/.tmp-apm-clone/` and is cleaned up at the end of the phase.
3. **Offline snapshot** at `.opencode/rules/packages-index.json` — shipped by the template, refreshed by `/update-workplace`. Warns the user that the snapshot may be stale.

Each script run records which step won under `sources[].resolvedVia` in `.opencode/.temp-apm-selection.json` (`https-raw` / `git-clone` / `https-external` / `offline-snapshot`). The initializer logs this value in `project_init.md` Decision Log §1.7.

HTML responses from a private registry (typical GitLab/Bitbucket login page returned at 200 OK) are detected by content-sniffing the response body and `Content-Type` header — the script will not feed HTML through `ConvertFrom-Json`. Instead it emits a clear "auth wall" diagnostic and proposes either `-AllowGitFallback`, an external mirror URL, or refreshing the offline snapshot manually.

### Index schema

The fields per entry are `name`, `version`, `description`, `path`, optional `ref`, and the embedded `xWorkplace` block. The initializer translates each accepted entry into an APM **dict-form (object-form) dependency** in the project's `apm.yml` (see Phase 1.7-APM Step 4 and the upstream [manifest schema](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/manifest-schema/) / [Object Form reference](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/consumer/manage-dependencies/)):

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    - git: <apmPackages.registryRepoUrl>   # Workplace-Agent-Packages repo .git URL
      path: <entry.path>                    # e.g. "frontend-developer" (bare id, repo root)
      ref: <entry.ref or apmPackages.registryBranch>
      alias: <entry.name>
      # type: gitlab                        # OPTIONAL — hints self-managed GitLab hosts for REST/token routing; git-transport clone + path extraction works without it too
      # targets: [opencode, claude]         # OPTIONAL — scope this dep to specific harnesses; omit to reach every active install target
```

> **Why dict form, and what the shorthand actually supports (re-verified on 0.28.0).** Per the upstream [OpenAPM grammar](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/specs/openapm-v0.1/) the shorthand is `[host/]owner/repo[/virtual-path][#ref]` — it is **not** github.com-only: `gitlab.com` is auto-detected, self-managed GitLab works once `GITLAB_HOST` (single host) or `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS` (comma-separated) is exported (or `type: gitlab` is set in object form), and Bitbucket / Azure DevOps have their own recognized shorthand prefixes ([private-and-org-packages](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/consumer/private-and-org-packages/)). What is still true, and why Workplace keeps emitting dict form unconditionally: (1) an unrecognized/un-hinted self-hosted FQDN (Workplace's actual case, `git.netcracker.com`, with no `GITLAB_HOST` set anywhere in the initializer flow) cannot be reliably parsed by the ambiguous `host/owner/repo/virtual-path` shorthand — APM has no way to tell where `repo` ends and `virtual-path` begins without a host-type hint; (2) upstream explicitly recommends object form over shorthand once repo nesting goes deeper than `group/subgroup/repo`, which is comparable to Workplace's `DEMO.SE.AI/Workplace-Agent-Packages/<package-id>` shape; (3) dict form needs zero extra environment configuration and is what every Workplace flow already emits. **Net effect: dict form remains correct and mandatory for Workplace — but do not claim the shorthand "only works on github.com"; that is host-classification-dependent, not a blanket rule.** 0.26.0 additionally fixed two things that affect self-hosted GitLab specifically: custom ports are now preserved in HTTP git URLs written to `apm.yml` (and accepted in shorthand), and the package cache no longer confuses nested GitLab repositories with each other — relevant to the `DEMO.SE.AI/Workplace-Agent-Packages` group nesting.

The optional per-dependency `targets:` field (plural) is not currently used by Workplace-generated `apm.yml` entries — every accepted package is meant to reach the project's pinned target (`opencode`) — but it is safe to add manually if a package should be scoped to a subset of harnesses. Effective reach is `active install targets ∩ dependency targets`; listing a harness the install did not select does not add it, and `targets: []` is a parse error (omit the key to mean "all").

### Target resolution and the manifest `targets:` field (re-verified on 0.28.0)

`apm install` / `apm compile` resolve the active target list in this order, first match wins:

1. `--target` / `-t` on the command line (`--target all` for the auto-detectable expansion).
2. `targets:` in the project's `apm.yml`.
3. A machine default set with `apm config set target <value>`.
4. Auto-detection from filesystem signals (`.opencode/` selects `opencode`; every harness directory selects its own target).

If none of the four produce a target, `apm install` exits **2** with a teaching message rather than guessing. Consequences for Workplace:

- **Every Workplace-generated `apm.yml` pins `targets: [opencode]`** (Phase 1.7-APM Step 4). Auto-detection would also find `.opencode/`, but a machine default set with `apm config set target` (or `default_client` in `~/.apm/config.json`) ranks above auto-detection and would deploy the packages into another harness's directories. The install wrapper (`apm-install-preserving.js`) refuses to run without the field.
- **Packages that pin another harness are skipped.** A package whose own manifest declares e.g. `targets: [cursor]` does not overlap the project's `[opencode]`; APM prints `Package targets [cursor] do not overlap authorized active targets; skipping` and installs none of its primitives — but `apm compile` still compiles its `.apm/instructions/`. Treat such a package as unavailable for this line (Open Gap + remove from `apm.yml`).
- **Manifest-level `all` is deprecated.** A `target:`/`targets:` field containing `all` is treated as if the field were omitted, emits a once-per-run deprecation warning, and will become a hard parse error in a later release.
- **The manifest enum is narrower than the `--target` enum.** Top-level `target:` / `targets:` accepts only `agent-skills`, `antigravity`, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `grok-build`, `kiro`, `opencode`, `windsurf` — the list APM itself prints as `Valid targets:` when it rejects one (verified on 0.28.0). `intellij`, `vscode` and the experimental targets can only be requested with `--target`; an unknown value aborts the run.

## 5. Installation flow

### Initialization (Phase 1.7-APM)

```mermaid

    actor U as User
    participant I as /initialize agent
    participant W as Packages repo (HTTPS)
    participant X as External index URL

    participant H as Hook runtime (harness)

    U->>I: pick roles
    I->>U: registry source? (builtin / external / both)
    par
        I->>W: GET /index.json
        I->>X: GET <user URL>

    I->>I: merge + filter by targetRoles, prompt optional packs
    I->>I: write project's apm.yml dependencies.apm

    A-->>I: deploy primitives + merge MCP servers into opencode.json
    Note over H: activation: invoke scripts/activate directly -> marker<br/>(no package hooks on the opencode target)
```

Hard rules for every Workplace-driven `apm install` invocation:

1. **Every Workplace-driven install goes through the wrapper** `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/apm-install-preserving.js` (`--update [name]` for `apm update`, other flags passed through). It (a) refuses to run unless the project `apm.yml` declares `targets: [opencode]`, (b) snapshots every initialized `.agents/skills/<name>/project-config.json` and rendered `references/guidelines.md` before the install and restores them afterwards, logging each as `preserved:` — verified on 0.28.0: a plain `apm install` overwrites the initialized config with the package copy — and (c) reports every package APM skipped for target incompatibility (`Package targets [...] do not overlap authorized active targets`).
   >
   > **Two skill roots on the opencode target.** APM deploys package skills to **`.agents/skills/<name>/`** (`deploy_root=".agents"` in the target profile) and OpenCode reads that directory natively; the Core skills — including the two `coreContextSkills` — ship under **`.opencode/skills/`**. Every Workplace gate (`validate-apm-install.ps1`, `check-guidelines-specificity.js`, the docs-sync analysis) looks in both roots. No environment variable or legacy-path shim is used; the convergent path is the native one.
   >
   > **Hooks are not deployed.** The opencode target profile excludes hooks ("OpenCode has no hooks concept"), so the session-start descriptors packages ship are silently dropped — module activation is always the explicit script invocation of Section 6.
2. The MCP merger in APM is additive. The packages repo's CI rejects any package `apm.yml` whose `dependencies.mcp` declares a server name already shipped by Phase 1.5 (Context7, Atlassian, TaskMaster, Chrome DevTools) so duplicates never reach `opencode.json`.
3. The `AGENTS.md` co-ownership contract is `compilation.agents_md.mode: managed_section` (since template v4.5.0 / APM 0.28.0 — smoke-verified: `apm compile` does **not** emit the per-package `<!-- APM:<name> begin/end -->` markers the template previously assumed, and in default `full` mode it overwrites the whole file). Phase 1.7-APM writes the `compilation:` block into the generated `apm.yml`, and the generated `AGENTS.md` carries exactly one `<!-- apm:start -->` / `<!-- apm:end -->` pair. APM rewrites only the region between those markers; Phase 7 of `/initialize` edits Workplace-managed sections **outside** the markers and must never delete or duplicate the pair.

### `AGENTS.md` co-ownership (managed_section)

The project's `apm.yml` generated by Phase 1.7-APM includes:

```yaml
compilation:
  agents_md:
    mode: managed_section
```

- `managed_section` mode tells `apm compile` to regenerate **only** the content between `<!-- apm:start -->` and `<!-- apm:end -->` in `AGENTS.md`, leaving everything outside untouched. The marker pair is inserted by the initializer's `agents-template.md` and, for existing projects, by migration `v4.5.0-apm-0-28-baseline`.
- `apm compile` (targets from `apm.yml`; or an `apm install` that triggers compilation) populates the region with the compiled instructions of the project and its packages. Running compile on a project whose `AGENTS.md` lacks the markers is safe: APM appends a new managed section instead of overwriting the file.
- Phase 7's AGENTS.md generation owns everything outside the markers (role sections, Project Conventions, etc.) and MUST preserve the marker pair and its content verbatim.
- The pre-v4.5.0 contract ("preserve every `<!-- APM:<name> begin/end -->` block written by `apm compile`") is **retired**: no APM version emits those markers. Projects initialized before v4.5.0 are migrated by `/update-workplace` (see migration `v4.5.0-apm-0-28-baseline`).
- Upstream reference: [apm compile](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/cli/compile/) and the producer compile guide's `managed_section` mode.

### Lockfile

`apm.lock.yaml` is committed to the consumer project. APM's `apm install` is fully reproducible from the lockfile — the registry index is only consulted on `apm update` or when adding a new dependency.

#### ⚠️ A poisoned lock entry is permanent until purged by hand

Because the lockfile — not the materialized tree — decides whether a dependency needs work, an entry written by an interrupted install can make a package unrecoverable by normal means:

```yaml
- name: api
  version: unknown
  package_type: invalid
  content_hash: sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
```

`sha256:e3b0c442…b855` is SHA-256 of empty input. With such an entry present, every later `apm install` prints `(files unchanged)` for that package and re-materialises nothing. What is left behind passes every naive check: `apm_modules/<pkg>/` exists (with zero files), `.agents/skills/<name>/` may exist (empty or partial), and `apm install` exits 0. In this template the consequence is specific — all `*-context` skills come from packages, so the failure surfaces phases later at the Phase 6 Part 3.5 guidelines gate.

Detection and remediation:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/validate-apm-install.ps1
```

The script checks lock integrity, empty cached trees, and completeness of every required context skill (`SKILL.md` + `references/template.md`), and prints the purge command per finding: remove the cached tree, then drop the entry from `apm.lock.yaml` (or delete the lockfile to force a full re-resolve), then re-install. Phase 1.7-APM runs it as a pre-flight over inherited state (step 5.0b) and as the post-install gate (step 5.1a).

Two rules that follow from the mechanism:

- **Re-running `apm install` is not a fix.** The lock entry still looks current, so APM does the same nothing again.
- **Never hand-create the missing files.** A hand-written `SKILL.md` or `references/template.md` satisfies the gate and leaves a permanently stubbed skill; the owning package is the only valid source.

The root cause is upstream in `apm-cli`: `apm install` trusts the lock entry instead of inspecting the materialized tree, so a degenerate entry is never re-resolved. Nothing on the consumer side can prevent APM from writing it — only detect and purge it.

### Security scan

APM runs a security scan and asks for confirmation before installing any package that declares `dependencies.mcp` (transitive MCP servers). The agent reports the prompt verbatim to the user and never auto-accepts.

## 6. Post-install activation (modules)

Full modules ship a one-shot session-start hook descriptor (`.apm/hooks/activate.json`) plus a `scripts.activate` entry in `apm.yml`. **On the opencode target the hook is never deployed** (the target profile excludes hooks), so direct script invocation is the only activation path.

1. *(Not on this target.)* APM's hook merge would deploy `.apm/hooks/activate.json` into a harness's native hook config (Claude Code and similar); the opencode target skips it, so nothing fires on session start.
2. The script checks `.workplace/activated/<package-name>.marker`. If present, exits 0.
3. The script performs package-specific work:
   - Render `references/guidelines.md` from `references/template.md` + `project-config.json` (the Phase 6 Part 3.5 gate).
   - For full modules, copy the `runtime/<RootFolder>/` tree into the project root and `runtime/config.json` into `.workplace/<package-name>/config.json`.
   - Append `<package-name>` to `.workplace/state.json` with `status: "active"`.
4. The script writes the marker file and exits 0.

**Primary path (and the only reliable one).** There is **no** `apm run activate -p <pkg>` command upstream — `apm run [SCRIPT_NAME]` only executes the **top-level project's own** `apm.yml` `scripts:` block (with `-p/--param NAME=VALUE` reserved for parameter substitution, not package selection); it cannot target a script inside an installed dependency by name. Use one of these instead:

- Invoke the deployed script directly (works everywhere, no ambiguity): `bash <package-root>/scripts/activate.sh` (POSIX) or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <package-root>/scripts/activate.ps1` (Windows), where `<package-root>` is resolved as described below. The printed `powershell …` form abbreviates the canonical rule — `pwsh -File …` where `pwsh` resolves (the only PowerShell binary on macOS/Linux), otherwise `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File …` — see [`environment-setup.md` → Running the Workplace `.ps1` scripts](environment-setup.md#running-the-workplace-ps1-scripts-read-before-the-first-script-call).
- If (and only if) the package's own `apm.yml` declares `scripts: { activate: ... }`, `cd <package-root> && apm run activate` also works, because `apm run` resolves against the `apm.yml` in the current working directory.

### 6.1 Resolving `<package-root>` — do not guess it

`apm_modules/<package-name>/` is **not** a reliable path. For the dict-form git dependencies Workplace generates, APM lays the cache out by git coordinates, so the real root looks like `apm_modules/DEMO.SE.AI/Workplace-Agent-Packages/<package-id>/`; with an `alias:` it may instead be `apm_modules/<alias>/`. Resolve it, never assume it:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+ - the package root is the directory that has BOTH apm.yml and runtime/
Get-ChildItem -Path apm_modules -Recurse -Filter apm.yml |
  Where-Object { Test-Path (Join-Path $_.Directory.FullName 'runtime') } |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty Directory
```

```bash
# POSIX
find apm_modules -name apm.yml -exec sh -c 'test -d "$(dirname "$1")/runtime" && dirname "$1"' _ {} \;
```

> On the opencode target only one copy of the activation script exists — the one under `apm_modules/` resolved above (hook-side copies exist only on hook-merge targets such as Claude Code).

### 6.2 Verify by artifacts, not by the marker

The marker is written by the script, so it proves only that the script reached its last line — not that it did any work. Treat activation as complete only when the **payload** is present:

| Declared in the package | Expected in the project |
|---|---|
| `runtime/config.json` | `.workplace/<package-name>/config.json` |
| `runtime/<RootFolder>/` (per `movesRuntimeFolder: true`) | `<RootFolder>/` at the project root |
| `contextSkills` entries | `.agents/skills/<skill>/references/guidelines.md` |

Run the check instead of eyeballing it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/verify-apm-activation.ps1
```

The script enumerates every `type: module` package in `apm_modules/`, compares each one's `runtime/` payload against the project, and classifies it as `OK`, `NOT_ACTIVATED`, `FALSE_POSITIVE`, `PARTIAL`, or `PACKAGE_INCOMPLETE`. It exits 1 when anything is falsely or partially activated, prints the correct (resolved) activation command per package, and lists any hook-side decoy scripts it found. `-Repair` deletes the false-positive markers and their `state.json` entries so the next real run is not swallowed by idempotency; `-Json` emits the same findings machine-readably for use inside a phase gate.

Re-running the activation script with the marker present is a no-op — activation is strictly idempotent. Delete `.workplace/activated/<package-name>.marker` first (or run the verifier with `-Repair`) to force a clean re-run.

## 7. Update flow

| Action | Command | What it updates |
|---|---|---|
| Inspect one installed package's metadata / files | `apm view <name>` | Reads `apm.lock.yaml` + `apm_modules/`. There is **no** `apm show` command — it does not exist upstream; `apm view` is the correct command (and has been since long before 0.13.0). |
| List installed packages (all of them) | `apm list` — **does NOT do this.** `apm list` prints the `scripts:` map declared in the project's own `apm.yml`, not installed dependencies. | To enumerate installed packages, read `apm.lock.yaml` directly, or run `apm view <name>` per package, or `apm deps list` / `apm deps tree` for the dependency graph. |
| List outdated packages | `apm outdated` | All packages tracked in `apm.lock.yaml`. Read-only. |
| Update everything | `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/apm-install-preserving.js --update` | Re-resolves every dependency, prints a plan (added / updated / removed / unchanged), prompts once for consent (`Apply these changes? [y/N]`), then rewrites the lockfile. Add `--yes` for non-interactive runs, `--dry-run` for a read-only plan. The env var is mandatory — `apm update` has no `--legacy-skill-paths` flag, and without the variable it migrates `.opencode/skills/` to `.agents/skills/`. |
| Update one package | `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/apm-install-preserving.js --update <name>` | Same, scoped. Fixed in 0.26.0: a selective update no longer marks the dependencies you *didn't* name as removed. |
| Reproducible install in CI | `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/apm-install-preserving.js --frozen` | Lockfile-only install (the `npm ci` equivalent): refuses to resolve anything new and fails if `apm.yml` and `apm.lock.yaml` have drifted. This — not plain `apm install` — is the correct CI command. Structural check only; pair with `apm audit --ci` for content hashes. |
| Remove orphaned packages and stale deployed files | `apm prune` | Cleans up packages no longer in `apm.yml` plus files they left behind, and (0.26.0) reconciles merged-hook ownership and the deployment ledger after removal. |
| Diagnose a broken environment | `apm doctor` (`--verbose`) | Pass/fail table for git, network, credential resolution, marketplace config, and executable trust. Only git + network affect the exit code. |
| Update the APM **CLI** itself | `apm self-update` (`--check` to only check) | Downloads and installs the latest CLI release in place — prefer this over re-running the Phase 0 install one-liner. |
| Refresh the Workplace **Core template** (rules, agents, skills, commands, docs) | `/update-workplace` | NOT an APM operation — handled by `.opencode/skills/project-update` against `templateSource` in `.core-version.json`. |
| Refresh the offline registry snapshot at `.opencode/rules/packages-index.json` | `/update-workplace` | Same flow; written alongside Core update. |

The two flows have **different scopes but are not independent**. `apm update` re-resolves installed packages and redeploys their primitives in `.opencode/agents/`, `.opencode/commands/`, `.agents/skills/`. `/update-workplace` refreshes the Workplace Core — and then, at Step 3.5.b, runs `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/apm-install-preserving.js` itself (see [`core-update.md`](../../project-update/references/core-update.md)), so a Core update also redeploys package primitives from the current lockfile. Both are safe to run repeatedly, but neither preserves hand-edits to APM-owned files — that is what the project's own `.apm/` overrides are for.

## 8. Authoring new packages

Use the `/package-new` slash command (provided by the `apm-packaging` skill). Packages are authored in a local clone of the **Workplace-Agent-Packages** repo (where the `_templates/`, `_schema/`, and `scripts/regenerate-index.ps1` live at the repo root); the command writes the new `<id>/` directory there. It supports three sources:

| Source | Invocation | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Existing module | `/package-new --from-module <name-or-path>` | Reads a module folder (external clone path), maps `agents/` → `.apm/agents/*.agent.md`, `skills/` → `.apm/skills/*/`, `commands/` → `.apm/prompts/*.prompt.md`, the init command → `scripts/activate.sh`; populates `x-workplace`. |
| Single skill | `/package-new --from-skill <skill-name>` | Reads a `.opencode/skills/<name>/` folder and wraps it as a `type: skill` package with no agents or commands. |
| Blank | `/package-new <id>` | Copies the packages repo's `_templates/role-pack/` (or `_templates/module/` or `_templates/skill/`) with placeholders filled. |

All three modes finish by running `apm pack --dry-run`, plus `apm compile --validate` when the package actually has something compilable (`.apm/instructions/` or `.apm/agents/`) — compile exits non-zero on a package with nothing to compile, which is why the packages repo's CI skips that gate for `type: skill` and prompts-only packages. The command also calls the packages repo's `scripts/regenerate-index.ps1` so `index.json` stays in sync, then prints a CONTRIBUTING checklist.

Two 0.26.0 fixes worth knowing while authoring: `apm pack` now packs subdirectory-prefixed skills correctly (previously they could be dropped from the bundle), and `apm marketplace` authoring config lives in a `marketplace:` block inside `apm.yml` — the standalone `marketplace.yml` is deprecated (`apm marketplace migrate` folds it in). Additions at the 0.28.0 baseline: `apm pack` no longer fails on a package whose `dependencies.apm` / `dependencies.mcp` lists are empty (previously a blocking validation error, now clean), and the manifest gained an object-form `skills:` field for skill-only dependency declarations. Note that validation is still lenient about the **`dependencies.mcp` shape**: it must be a **list** of objects (`- name: …`, `transport: …`), and a map-shaped `mcp:` block is silently ignored at install time — the packages repo's CI should check this explicitly (see the [`apm-packaging` skill](../../apm-packaging/SKILL.md) validation gate table and anti-pattern list).

Manual authoring (writing `<id>/` by hand in the packages repo and submitting a PR there) is also supported and runs the same CI gates.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `apm --version` works in a new terminal but the agent's Shell tool still says "command not recognized" / "not found" | The agent's child Shell session inherited `PATH` from the OpenCode parent process **before** the installer added `~/.apm/bin` to the User PATH. The OS PATH is updated but the live process tree hasn't re-read it. | **Windows / PowerShell:** `$env:PATH = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","User")` — then re-run `apm --version`. **Unix:** `export PATH="$HOME/.apm/bin:$PATH"` (or `source ~/.bashrc`). As a final fallback, invoke `apm` by absolute path: Windows `& "$env:USERPROFILE\.apm\bin\apm.exe"`, Unix `~/.apm/bin/apm`. As a last resort, fully quit and re-launch OpenCode so it inherits the refreshed PATH from the OS. |
| `apm: command not found` after Phase 0 install and PATH refresh didn't help | Installer truly failed, or chose an unexpected install location | Re-run installer with `--verbose`; if still broken, install via `pip install apm-cli` (deploys to the Python user-scripts dir, which is usually already on PATH). |
| `apm install` fails fetching a package | Network/auth issue with the host git server | Run `apm doctor` first (git / network / credential checks), then re-run the install with `--verbose`. For the self-managed GitLab registry, export `GITLAB_APM_PAT` (and `GITLAB_HOST=git.netcracker.com` if shorthand refs are ever used) or make sure the host's git credential helper is populated. |
| `SSLCertVerificationError` / `unable to get local issuer certificate` on any HTTPS host | Corporate CA missing from the **OS** trust store, or a stale `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` pinning APM to an old bundle | Since 0.26.0 APM verifies against the OS trust store by default, so the first fix is to install the corporate root there (Windows Trusted Root, macOS Keychain, `update-ca-certificates`). If a bundle must be pinned instead, set `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` (or `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`) to a PEM that contains **both** public roots and the corporate CA — it replaces the OS store, it does not augment it. `SSL_CERT_FILE` alone is not read by APM's HTTP layer. If `git`/`curl` succeed but `apm` fails, `unset REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE CURL_CA_BUNDLE` and retry. `APM_DISABLE_TRUSTSTORE=1` restores the legacy bundled-`certifi` path. Full flow: [SSL / TLS issues](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/troubleshooting/ssl-issues/). |
| `The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process` (Windows), or `Access is denied` running `apm.exe` | Antivirus / endpoint protection scanning temp files, or AppLocker / App Control blocking execution from a user-writable path | Set `APM_TEMP_DIR` to a policy-allowed directory and retry; `APM_DEBUG=1` shows the retry diagnostics. For AppLocker, ask the endpoint admin to allow `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\apm\*`. |
| `references/guidelines.md` missing after install | Expected — packages never ship the rendered file | Phase 6 Part 3 renders it, Part 3.5 verifies it. If `.agents/skills/<name>/` itself is missing, check `targets: [opencode]` in `apm.yml` and the wrapper's `incompatible-target` warnings. |
| `apm install` prints `(files unchanged)` and exits 0, but the package's skill directory is empty or missing `SKILL.md` / `references/template.md` | The package's `apm.lock.yaml` entry is poisoned by an earlier interrupted install (`version: unknown`, `package_type` not `apm_package`, or `content_hash: sha256:e3b0c442…b855` = empty input). APM trusts the entry and never re-resolves; it does not self-heal (Section 5 → Lockfile). | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/validate-apm-install.ps1` names each poisoned package and prints its purge command: delete `apm_modules/<pkg>/`, drop the entry from `apm.lock.yaml` (or delete the lockfile for a full re-resolve), then `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/apm-install-preserving.js`. Re-running the install alone changes nothing, and hand-creating the files leaves a permanently stubbed skill. |
| MCP transitive trust prompt blocks install | APM security scan asks for explicit consent | Report prompt verbatim; only accept on explicit user approval. |
| Package hook didn't fire | **Expected on the opencode target** — package hooks are not deployed | Activate modules with Phase 1.7-APM step 5.2 (`scripts/activate.*` + `verify-apm-activation.ps1`). |
| `.workplace/activated/<pkg>.marker` exists and `state.json` says `active`, but the module's runtime folder / `.workplace/<pkg>/config.json` never appeared | The activation script ran from a directory without a sibling `runtime/` (wrong package root) | Resolve the root per 6.1, then run the verifier with `-Repair` and activate again. |
| A module's activation "succeeded" but only part of the payload is there | Partial copy (interrupted run, permission error mid-copy, or a no-clobber merge that skipped pre-existing paths) | Same verifier — it reports `PARTIAL` with the exact missing `runtime/` entries. Re-run with `-Repair` and then the printed activation command; inspect `.workplace/<pkg>/activate.log` if the module writes one. |
| `activate.sh` failed mid-run | Permissions / missing python3 / partial copy | Re-running is safe but **not automatically effective**: if the failing run already wrote the marker, the retry exits 0 without doing anything. Run the verifier with `-Repair` first (Section 6.2), then re-invoke activation. |
| `index.json` drift error in CI | New / changed `apm.yml` not reflected in index | In the Workplace-Agent-Packages repo, run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/regenerate-index.ps1` and commit. |
