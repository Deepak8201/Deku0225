# Documentation Sync Command

> **Utility Command** - Synchronize documentation with local code/configuration changes

## Overview

This command triggers an on-demand documentation synchronization workflow using the Documentation Sync agent. It works for both the NC AI Workplace template itself and initialized projects.

## How to Use

Type `/docs-sync` in the OpenCode prompt to start documentation synchronization (the command is bound to the `documentation-sync` agent).

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` — parse `--report`, `--auto` or `--since=<period>` (`7d`, `2w`, a tag or a commit); empty arguments mean the interactive local-changes mode.

**Aliases:**
- "Sync documentation"
- "Update docs to reflect changes"
- "Synchronize documentation"

## Agent Delegation

**This command runs as the Documentation Sync agent** (bound by the frontmatter; another agent reading this text should read `.opencode/agents/documentation-sync.md` and follow it):

- The Documentation Sync agent reads the `documentation-management` skill
- The skill contains registry management, sync workflow, and markdown standards

**The Documentation Sync Agent will:**

1. **Context Detection:** Check `.opencode/rules/.core-version.json` to determine Template vs Project mode
2. **Scope Determination:** Identify document scope based on mode
3. **Scan for Staleness:** Cross-reference changed code with documentation
4. **Validate Links:** Run `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/validate-doc-links.js --json` to find broken references authoritatively instead of manual inspection
5. **Sync Context Skills (Project Mode only):** For every affected context skill, reconcile `project-config.json` first, then re-render `references/guidelines.md` from it — these are the artifacts agents actually load at runtime, and the order is not interchangeable. See *Context Skill Sync* in the `documentation-management` skill
6. **Propose Updates:** Present specific changes with before/after comparison
7. **Apply Changes:** Only after user approval
8. **Update Tracking:** Log changes in CHANGELOG.md
9. **Re-validate & Record State:** Re-run the validator to confirm no new broken links; in Project Mode also run `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/check-guidelines-specificity.js --required <skills touched>` to prove the synced guidelines are still grounded in the project (**never in Template Mode** — its context skills are uninitialized by design); then run `node .opencode/hooks/docs-sync-check.js --record-state` so the hook doesn't immediately re-recommend on the files this sync just touched

## Output Modes

### Interactive Mode (Default)

- Proposes each change individually
- Waits for user approval before applying
- Allows modification of proposals
- Best for careful review

### Report Mode

Triggered by: `/docs-sync --report` or "generate sync report"

- Generates markdown report without making changes
- Saves report to `docs/_sync_report.md` (temporary)
- Useful for review before applying changes

### Auto Mode

Triggered by: `/docs-sync --auto` or "auto-sync documentation"

- Applies all "safe" changes automatically
- Prompts only for risky changes (deletions, major rewrites)
- Best for routine synchronization

### Git History Mode

Triggered by: `/docs-sync --since=<period>` or when the agent recommends it after hook detection

Analyzes committed changes for the specified period and checks if documentation is stale relative to those commits:
- `/docs-sync --since=7d` — last 7 days
- `/docs-sync --since=2w` — last 2 weeks
- `/docs-sync --since=v1.2.0` — since git tag
- `/docs-sync --since=abc1234` — since specific commit

Agent will:
1. Run `git log --name-only --since=<period>` (or `git log --name-only <ref>..HEAD` for tags/commits) to get changed files
2. Apply the same category-to-skill mapping as local analysis
3. Scan documentation for staleness relative to those changes
4. Propose updates with before/after comparison

Can be combined with other modes: `/docs-sync --since=7d --report`

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: After Feature Implementation

```
User: "I just implemented user authentication with Auth0"

Agent:
1. Identifies change category: Authentication
2. Scans: SECURITY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, development.md, api-context skill
3. Proposes updates for each affected document
```

### Scenario 2: After Dependency Update

```
User: "Updated React from 18 to 19"

Agent:
1. Identifies change category: Dependencies
2. Scans: README.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, development.md
3. Proposes version updates across documentation
```

### Scenario 3: Periodic Health Check

```
User: "/docs-sync --report"

Agent:
1. Full scan mode activated
2. Checks all documentation for consistency
3. Validates all cross-references
4. Generates comprehensive report without changes
```

### Scenario 4: Hook-Triggered Recommendation

```
Agent completes a task that modified 3+ files (counting uncommitted changes
AND anything committed since the last sync/--record-state), added
dependencies, or changed architectural files (.opencode/agents/, rules/,
.opencode/hooks/, etc.). The docs-sync plugin submits the recommendation as the NEXT USER-ROLE MESSAGE
of the session once the agent is idle — OpenCode starts an agent turn on it, so
it is not a passive note the agent can ignore; the agent responds to it like
any other user message (rule: `orchestrator.md → Documentation Sync
Recommendations`).

The message itself carries an "AGENT INSTRUCTION" block that is binding:

Agent (upon receiving the auto-submitted message):
1. Does NOT start any sync immediately, even though it looks like a user
   request — the message explicitly forbids that
2. Presents exactly the two options named in the message and waits for the
   user's actual next reply:
   a) /docs-sync for current uncommitted + committed-since-last-sync changes
   b) /docs-sync --since=<period> for a deeper git history analysis than what
      the hook's own commit tracking already covered
3. If the user dismisses or asks something unrelated — does nothing further
4. On explicit choice — runs the selected mode (see Step 9 above: both modes
   end with re-validating links, verifying context-skill specificity in
   Project Mode, and calling docs-sync-check.js --record-state)
```

The hook message's "Context skill artifacts that may need refresh" list names
both `project-config.json` and `references/guidelines.md` per affected skill —
feed it directly into Step 5 instead of re-deriving the mapping.

### Scenario 5: Git History Analysis

```
User: "/docs-sync --since=2w"

Agent:
1. Runs git log --name-only --since=2.weeks.ago
2. Maps changed files to categories and skills
3. Scans documentation for staleness relative to those commits
4. Proposes updates with before/after comparison
```

### Scenario 6: Template Development

```
User: "sync template docs"

Agent:
1. Forces Template Mode
2. Scans all template documentation
3. Validates Core rules and docs consistency
4. Updates CHANGELOG.md with changes
```

## Integration with Documentation Sync Agent

This command works with the Documentation Sync agent's proactive BEFORE/AFTER workflows:

| Aspect | AFTER-work auto-check | /docs-sync | /docs-sync --since |
|--------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Trigger** | Hook-suggested (user confirms) | On-demand (user initiated) | On-demand or hook-suggested |
| **Scope** | Current task's impact | Full documentation scan | Git history for specified period |
| **Mode** | Reactive | Proactive or Reactive | Historical analysis |
| **Use Case** | During development | Periodic maintenance | Post-sprint or release review |

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't detect changes

- Try specifying scope: "sync docs for API changes"
- Use full scan mode: `/docs-sync --report`

### Too many changes proposed

- Use interactive mode for careful review
- Specify narrower scope: "sync only README"
- Skip non-critical updates

### Cross-reference validation fails

- Run `node .opencode/skills/project-initialization/scripts/validate-doc-links.js` (add `--all` if a gitignored doc might be involved) to get an authoritative list of broken links/anchors instead of checking paths by hand
- Update broken links manually, then re-run the validator to confirm
